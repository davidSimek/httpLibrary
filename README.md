## Introduction

I've often desired to explore server/client architecture, but faced the challenge of either repeatedly implementing HTTP functionality or relying on feature-rich libraries with more than necessary components. In response, I developed this solution. It offers a straightforward interface with heightened usability. With this tool, creating a basic HTTP server requires fewer than 10 lines of code, providing comprehensive control over the server's operations.
